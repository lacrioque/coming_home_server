# Coming Home

The problem is how to let our friends know what we are doing without telling the world through facebook, twiiter or google+?

It's easy, or may be easy.

## What this should do

This should be a server for an app where you can share your state, not status as in facebook or twitter, but state.

Think of Weasley's Clock from Harry Potter, something like that but mor 21st century.

A.E. Coming home. -> one click and your friends and family know you are coming home.

##Planned states are

-at work
-coming home
-on my way
-home
-private
-deathly peril ( *see Weasley's clock above*)
-waiting
